Borrowhelen Launcher is a simple launcher which is forked from DoomRunner (https://github.com/Youda008/DoomRunner) v1.7.3 by Youda008, and focuses on launching Borrowhelen with mods and organizing them easily.

Most of the features are the same as DoomRunner, but there are no multiplayer options or compatibility options for not making things confusing (Borrowhelen is made for single player) and not causing unwanted behavior by editing the compat settings.
